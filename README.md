Hi, I'm Stephen, a passionate backend software engineer from the UK. I take great care in the architecture and code quality of the things I build. When I have the time, I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer, you can find me dabbling with projects throughout Github.

 ### Cars ðŸš™

This is currently my main project i'm working on when I have some spare time. Cars is a sandbox environment to allow execution of untrusted code with fixed time, memory with support for output testing. It runs on all the major queue services, data stores with a focus on container execution.
