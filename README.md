Hi, I'm Stephen, a passionate backend software engineer from the UK. I take great care in the architecture and code quality of the things I build. When I have the time, I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer, you can find me dabbling with projects throughout Github.

 ### Cars (Compile & Run Sandbox) ðŸš™ - [stephensli/cars](https://github.com/stephensli/cars)

This is currently the main project I'm working on when I have some spare time. Cars is a sandbox environment to allow execution of untrusted code with fixed time, and memory with support for output testing. It runs on all the major queue services, and data stores with a focus on container execution.
